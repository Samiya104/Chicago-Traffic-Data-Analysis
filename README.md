# Chicago-Traffic-Data-Analysis
The goal of this project was to explore the use of MATLAB in a first-year engineering course. The project was able to implement basic data analysis on a Traffic dataset and provide information regarding the traffic patterns at differnet time for different routes. 
The porject was implemented by importing data from a csv file using MATLAB and creating 3D histograms to analyze traffic patterns at different times for over 29 routes. Using the command line interface and plotting features of MATLAB, a user friendly depiction of data was portrayed.
